### Part 1: Theoretical Analysis

#### Q1: How do AI-driven code generation tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot) reduce development time? What are their limitations?

AI-driven code generation tools provide context-sensitive suggestions, automate repetitive boilerplate, and speed up prototype development by leveraging vast data from public codebases. This enables developers to code faster and focus on higher-level logic. However, limitations include generated code quality issues (e.g., inefficiency, security bugs), lack of deep contextual understanding, and the risk of copying copyrighted or biased code.

#### Q2: Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning in Automated Bug Detection

Supervised learning detects bugs by learning from labeled examples (buggy vs. clean code), enabling accurate identification when labeled datasets are available. Unsupervised learning clusters code patterns to identify anomalies without pre-labeling, useful for finding unknown bugs but potentially with lower precision.

#### Q3: Why is bias mitigation critical when using AI for user experience personalization?

Unmitigated bias can reinforce stereotypes, exclude minority groups, and result in unfair experiences. Bias mitigation ensures diverse user needs are met, avoids ethical pitfalls, and supports inclusivity for all users.

#### Case Study: AIOps in Software Deployment

AIOps improves software deployment efficiency by automating error detection and optimizing resource allocation. Example 1: Machine learning models predict deployment failures, reducing downtime. Example 2: Automated log analysis speeds incident resolution, leading to faster rollbacks or fixes.
